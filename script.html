          Our project is a short animated instructional video designed to guide first-time visitors through the experience 
          of entering and using a gun range. Created as a digital safety resource, the video introduces essential 
          administrative requirements, such as bringing valid ID, alongside core safety rules and expectations. It opens 
          in a simple classroom-style setting where these foundational points are introduced before transitioning into 
          the main areas of the gun range: the rental counter and shooting booths. The video aims to help new shooters 
          feel informed and confident through a combination of clear visual storytelling, first-person perspective, and 
          collaborative production by all team members.

          From the range lobby to the shooting lane, the animation walks the viewer through every step of the process. 
          After donning safety goggles and ear protection, the user assembles the AK-47, loads the magazine, and chambers 
          a round. Through a first-person lens, viewers are taught proper handling and body positioning, while the mechanics 
          of the gas-operated, rotating bolt system are clearly illustrated. The video then shifts to a third-person view 
          to capture the moment of firing in a stylized, slow-motion sequence, highlighting recoil and bullet trajectory 
          with visual effects. A zoomed-in view of the target and an on-screen reminder reinforce key safety practices to 
          conclude the sequence.
