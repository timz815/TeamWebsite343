          Our project is a short animated instructional video designed to guide first-time visitors through the experience 
          of entering and using a gun range. Created as a digital safety resource, the video introduces essential 
          administrative requirements, such as bringing valid ID, alongside core safety rules and expectations. It opens 
          in a simple classroom-style setting where these foundational points are introduced before transitioning into 
          the main areas of the gun range: the rental counter and shooting booths. The video aims to help new shooters 
          feel informed and confident through a combination of clear visual storytelling, first-person perspective, and 
          collaborative production by all team members.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the range lobby to the shooting lane, the animation walks the viewer through every step of the process. 
          After donning safety goggles and ear protection, the user assembles the AK-47, loads the magazine, and chambers 
          a round. Through a first-person lens, viewers are taught proper handling and body positioning, while the mechanics 
          of the gas-operated, rotating bolt system are clearly illustrated. The video then shifts to a third-person view 
          to capture the moment of firing in a stylized, slow-motion sequence, highlighting recoil and bullet trajectory 
          with visual effects. A zoomed-in view of the target and an on-screen reminder reinforce key safety practices to 
          conclude the sequence.

        <p>
Scene 1: Classroom Overview <br>
A quiet classroom-like space sets the tone.<br>
On the table: a flyer with safety rules, a valid ID, a pair of goggles, and earmuffs.<br>
A wall poster titled “Range Safety Rules” catches the eye.<br>
The camera slowly zooms in on the table as the items are looked over.<br>
An animated checklist pops up briefly:<br>
– Bring valid ID<br>
– Wear your safety gear<br>
– Follow all instructions<br>
<br>
Scene 2: Entering the Range<br>
We transition to the range lobby — modern, clean, and well-lit.<br>
The camera pans across signs and safety notices as the user walks toward the rental counter.<br>
They present their ID to the staff.<br>
In return, they’re given a rifle case, ammo, and protective gear.<br>
<br>
Scene 3: Getting Set Up<br>
Now inside a shooting booth.<br>
The table is ready with the disassembled AK-47, a loaded magazine, ammo, and safety gear.<br>
The user puts on their goggles and earmuffs.<br>
We get quick shots of them opening the rifle case and neatly arranging everything.<br>
<br>
Scene 4: First-Person Assembly<br>
The perspective shifts — now we’re seeing everything through the user’s eyes.<br>
Their hands begin assembling the AK-47.<br>
Once the magazine is in place, they pull back the charging handle to chamber a round.<br>
A short on-screen label fades in: “Chambered – Ready to Fire.”<br>
<br>
Scene 5: How It Works<br>
A brief mechanical breakdown appears as an overlay.<br>
Trigger pull. Primer ignition.<br>
The bullet is fired, and gas pressure pushes the bolt carrier back.<br>
The empty casing ejects as a new round loads.<br>
It’s quick but clear — showing exactly what’s happening inside the rifle.<br>
<br>
Scene 6: Taking the Shot<br>
The camera pulls back to a third-person angle.<br>
The user takes a firm, proper stance.<br>
In slow motion, they fire.<br>
We see the muzzle flash, recoil, and a shell casing flip out.<br>
A subtle bullet trail follows its path toward the target.<br>
<br>
Scene 7: Impact and Reminder<br>
The bullet hits the paper target — a burst of dust and motion.<br>
The camera zooms in on the point of impact.<br>
On-screen text appears:<br>
– Always point the firearm downrange<br>
– Unload and clear your weapon after use<br>
<br>
Scene 8: Closing<br>
The screen fades to black.<br>
Credits and the team’s GitHub site appear at the end.<br>
